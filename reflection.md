I spoke to Clara from Section 1 and Seunghyeon from Section 2. I attended Monday and Tuesday TA hours as well as office hours on Tuesday. 

Java is actually growing on me. Not having indentation count too much confused me at first. It also allowed for my code to get messier than I would've liked. 

As mentioned in class I was actually able to detect the errors a lot sooner. I suppose that it made me more decisive in exactly how I was moving forward. Whereas in Python, I might've just gone down the wrong path and realized it was too late. 

For instance, my biggest struggle with this code was finding when I could actually implement my canned response. I needed some way to break out of the for loop that I was in. I couldn't break into that logic gate at all even though I got the random method to work.

I am glad that I got it to include both mirrored words but to preserve what didn't need to be mirrored. I have some ideas floating around for how I could get the canned responses to come into play but getting into the built in methods like contains took a lot of reading that I felt I didn't have time for in the end. 

UPDATE: I've decided to turn my assignment in even though the code is pretty broken as it. The canned responses don't intialize at the right time. Part of this is the confusion with the for loops.
